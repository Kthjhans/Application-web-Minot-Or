# Minot'Or Web Application Development Plan

## Project Overview
Minot'Or aims to streamline operations between flour mills and bakeries through a new web application. This application will centralize purchasing and sales processes, replacing outdated systems.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup
- **Define Architecture:** Choose the architecture for the web, mobile, and desktop platforms.
- **Technology Selection:** Decide on the frameworks and technologies (e.g., Spring Boot, React).
- **Setup Development Environment:** Prepare local and shared development environments.

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- **Database Schema Design:** Define the database schema for products, orders, inventory, and user management.
- **API Development:**
  - Implement RESTful API using Spring Boot.
  - Define endpoints for user management, order processing, and inventory management.
- **Security Implementation:**
  - Integrate Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
  - Use JWT for secure token management.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- **UI/UX Design:** Design the user interface and user experience based on functional requirements.
- **React Setup:**
  - Initialize a new React application.
  - Setup routing and state management using React Router and Context API/Redux.
- **Component Development:**
  - Develop components for product browsing, order management, and analytics dashboard.

### Phase 4: Testing
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Implement unit tests for backend services and frontend components.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Conduct integration tests to ensure that frontend and backend work seamlessly together.
- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Use tools like Cypress to perform end-to-end testing.

### Phase 5: Deployment
- **Containerization:**
  - Dockerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:**
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- **Deployment to Production:**
  - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Heroku).

### Phase 6: Maintenance and Scaling
- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Monitor the applicationâ€™s performance and optimize as needed.
- **Error Logging and Handling:**
  - Implement centralized error logging (e.g., using ELK stack).
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Establish a feedback loop with users to continuously improve the application.

## Security Considerations
Ensure all data transactions are secure, implement proper access controls, and regularly update the security measures.

## Conclusion
This plan outlines the comprehensive steps needed to develop the Minot'Or web application, focusing on efficient operations and a robust, user-friendly interface.
